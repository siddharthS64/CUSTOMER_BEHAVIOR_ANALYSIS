# 🛍️ Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis
## 📌 Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of customer shopping behavior using a multi-tool approach. By leveraging Python for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), MySQL for structured data querying, and Power BI for interactive visualization, the project uncovers key insights into consumer demographics, purchasing patterns, and revenue drivers.

## 📊 Dataset Description

The analysis is based on the customer_shopping_behavior.csv dataset, which includes 3,900+ records of customer transactions. Key attributes include:

  - 👤 **Demographics:** Age, Gender, Location.

  -💳 **Transaction Details:** Item Purchased, Category, Purchase Amount (USD), Payment Method.

  -🎗️ **Customer Loyalty:** Subscription Status, Previous Purchases, Frequency of Purchases.

  -⭐ **Feedback:** Review Rating.

## ⚙️ Project Workflow

1. 🐍 **Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)**
  The Python EDA.ipynb notebook handles the initial data processing:

    - 🧹**Data Cleaning:** Identifying missing values and ensuring data consistency.

    - 📈**Statistical Analysis:** Analyzing distribution of age, purchase amounts, and ratings using Pandas and NumPy.

    - 🎨**Visualization:** Using Seaborn and Matplotlib to identify correlations between subscription status and spending.

    - 🚀**ETL:** Automating the data loading process into a MySQL database via SQLAlchemy.

2. 🗄️ **Database Management & SQL Querying**
   Structured queries were developed in SQL queries.sql to answer specific business questions:

    - 💰**Revenue Insights:** Comparing total revenue generated by gender and age groups.

    - 🚚**Shipping Impact:** Comparing average spend between Standard and Express shipping.

    - 👥**Customer Segmentation:** Categorizing customers into 'New', 'Returning', and 'Loyal' based on purchase history.

    - 🏆**Trend Analysis:** Identifying the top 3 most purchased products within each category.

3. 📉 **Data Visualization (Power BI)**
  The PowerBI Dashboard.pbix transforms the raw data into an interactive executive summary. Key features include:

    - 🎴**KPI Cards:** Real-time tracking of Total Revenue, Average Rating, and Total Customers.

    - 🔍**Slicers:** Filtering data by Category, Gender, and Location.

    - 📅**Revenue Breakdowns:** Visualizing purchase trends across different seasons and payment methods.

## 💡 Key Insights

  -⚥ **Gender Dynamics:** Analysis of revenue contribution between male and female segments.
  
  - 💎**Subscription Value:** Evaluation of whether subscribed customers actually exhibit higher average spend compared to non-subscribers.

  - 🔝**Product Performance:** Identification of high-rated products that drive customer satisfaction.

  - 🌍**Geographic Trends:** Mapping purchase frequency across different states and locations.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

  - **Language:** Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SQLAlchemy)

  - **Database:** MySQL

  - **Visualization:** Power BI

  - **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 How to Use

  1. **Database Setup:** Run the Python EDA.ipynb to clean the CSV and load it into your local MySQL instance.

  2. **Analysis:** Execute the queries in SQL queries.sql to generate tabular insights.

  3. **Visualization:** Open the PowerBI Dashboard.pbix file to explore the interactive visualizations.
